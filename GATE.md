# GATE

## Gate 1: PATH Admissibility (Before Work)

### Question
Does the intended PATH conform to LAW?

### PASS if
- PATH does not contradict any LAW rule.
- Scope is explicit and bounded.
- No non-canonical or speculative rules were added.
- Required inputs are present or explicitly listed as blockers.

### FAIL if
- Any LAW contradiction exists.
- Scope creep is present.
- Required decisions are missing.
- PATH contains ambiguous action that can alter architecture without review.

### On FAIL
- Record FAIL in `TRACE.md`.
- Stop or produce a new PATH and re-run Gate 1.

## Gate 2: REALITY Admissibility (Before Accept/Merge)

### Question
Does REALITY conform to PATH and LAW, with TRACE evidence?

### PASS if
- Produced artifacts match permitted PATH steps.
- No forbidden LAW condition appears in REALITY.
- TRACE includes exact files changed and outcomes.
- Deviations are documented and resolved.

### FAIL if
- REALITY deviates from PATH without explicit approval.
- TRACE is incomplete or missing.
- LAW was implicitly changed.

### On FAIL
- Record FAIL in `TRACE.md`.
- Stop, then either revert pathologically unsafe change or redefine PATH and re-run gates.
